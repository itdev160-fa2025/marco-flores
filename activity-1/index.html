        <title>Pick Up Soccer</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Enjoy the game, have fun!</h1>
        <p>We believe that soccer is for <strong>everyone</strong>.<br/>
        It doesn't require you to be a pro to gather around and play with others.<br/>
        Every skill level is welcome to come over and play.</p>

        <p>We rent 2 fields at Milwaukee Yard for 2<sup>hrs</sup>. Only 28 slots will be open to register
         and play so each team will consist of 7 players (1 GK and 6 players on field). Each player will
         pay $10 to ensure a spot. <strong>Any age is welcome to play.</strong><br/>
        Games will last 10 min with the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                No slide tackles.
            </li>
            <li>
                No fights. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <P><em>You can still be competitive without trying to hurt a player.
            We will appreciate to consider
            that pick up games are meant to be fun.</em></P>
