            <p>I purchased this within the last couple of weeks. So far so good. It is much louder than 
                my Bose Soundlink Color 2s that I have.

            <p>I have had this thing for a couple weeks now and so far I love it! It charges up fairly quickly
                 and the charge lasts almost all day. A round of golf and a barbecue after and it was still running strong.
